It can power entire galaxies and even your own body (if you eat it). You could live entirely off of quanola, which is fortunate, because in an attempt to escape with your stolen quanola you were shot down and stranded on a boring planet called Earth by the String Cops. The String Cops are the horrible intersection between String Theory and abusive oversight. Anyways, you have got to get back to your ship with as much quanola as you can, because after being shot down, you and all your quanola fell out of the ship. All you need is at least one quanola grain to repower your ship, but that would be so embarrassing to have only one quanola and go home to your deprived galaxy empty handed. So better save as much as you can on your way back.\n\nBefore you are three paths: The forest, the mountains, and the plains, which will you enter?\n\n",
